        <h2 class="headline">Hi, my name is Calvin, Iâ€™m a software engineer & am
            enthusiastic
            about bringing your
            projects to life.
        </h2>
        <p class="bio">I am a recent graduate from the Engineering
            Immersion Career Path bootcamp at Thinkful.
            I bring a unique perspective to whatever project I encounter due to my well rounded background and my
            training as a Fullstack Developer.</p>

        <p class="bio">Ever since I was a child and disassembled my families desktop and reassembled it I have
            had a
            fascination with technology, creative solutions, and just how far my creativity and intellect can take
            me,
            my
            projects and my hobbies. That is one of my driving forces is being able to run into new an interesting
            challenges to overcome and that is why I stand out from other coders. Because I LIKE working on code and
            because
            my work ethic shines through when a challenge would stump others.</p>
        <p class="bio">
            As a previous manager and teacher I can communicate with others
            on my team exceptionally well. My degree in psychology gives me the specialized
            training and know-how to communicate in different styles as needed in order to help facilitate a deeper
            comprehension.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            My experience working as a fiber optics technician gives me a unique
            perspective on problem solving and how each portion of a job can be
            a unique fun and engaging puzzle.

        <p>
            This quiz takes the user through an 8 question quiz to test their music theory knowledge.
            It gives feedback on whether the selected answer was right or wrong and then progresses to the next
            question.
            At the end of the quiz the user may retake the quiz again.</p>

        <h2 class="projecttitle">Petful Adoption Agency</h2>
        <p>
            This application is a 'first in first out' adoption agency application with dummy data. It allows the
            user
            to
            see the landing page, begin the adoption process, choose a pet to adopt and then take home! As a user
            adopts
            from the agency their user is removed from the list of available adopters until eventually none are
            left.
            This
            is a work in progress. The WIP portion is making it so when pets/users are 'run out of' the user is
            notified
            and
            brought to the landing page and the list of adopters and adoptees are refreshed</p>

        <h2 class="projecttitle">Maori in Motion</h2>
        <p>Maori in Motion is an application which uses the spaced repetition method in order to teach users a new
            language in a more efficient way. It utilizes an algorithm wherein the user is given words and asked to
            give
            the correct answer, the more often a word is guessed correctly the more it spaces out the repeating of
            that
            word, giving the user more chances to guess words that they have failed more often. The more the user
            repeats a word incorrectly the more exposure they have to that word and the correct response, thereby
            increasing their exposure to the correct answer and increasing comprehension time.</p>
        <p class="projectParagraph">The Maori in Motion App uses HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React, Nodemon,
            Express,
            Chai, Mocha, Cypress, Helmet, Supertest, Jest, XSS, bcrypt, knex, PostgreSQL, and JSON..</p>

        <h2 class="projecttitle">Kitchen Helper 2020</h2>
        <p>Kitchen Helper 2020 is the second version of Kitchen Helper, it was collaborated on
            with
            three other developers, names found in the README file. During this project I was the QA Lead and was in
            charge of making sure that we had 100% coverage down every API ENDPOINT, and every client sclasse
            component
            with 100% passing tests. I was also in charge of making sure that user stories were fulfilled during
            construction of the application and that nothing was left out from the original design.
            This is my third full-stack project. It is meant to be an all around kitchen assistant and help you
            achieve efficiency in the kitchen.</p>
